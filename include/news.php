<p>ImageMagick recommended practices <strong>strongly</strong> encourage you to configure a <a href="<?php echo $_SESSION['RelativePath']?>/../script/security-policy.php">security policy</a> that best suits your local environment.</p>

<p class="bg-light text-dark mx-4">We are utilizing a new community <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick6/discussions">discussion</a> service.  The previous <a target="_blank" href="https://legacy.imagemagick.org/discourse-server">discourse server</a> remains available to read legacy <a target="_blank" href="https://legacy.imagemagick.org/discourse-server~">discussions</a>.</p>

<p>We discovered a bug in the pseudo-random generator prior to ImageMagick 6.9.10-81, the first 3 values repeated because the random state was not initialized properly.  As a consequence of the fix, expect a different numerical sequence when seeding (-seed).</p>


<p>As an analog to linear (RGB) and non-linear (sRGB) color colorspaces, as of ImageMagick 6.9.9-29, we introduce the LinearGray colorspace.  Gray is non-linear grayscale and LinearGray is linear (e.g. -colorspace linear-gray).</p>

<p>ImageMagick <a href="https://imagemagick.org">version 7</a> has been released. We encourage you to migrate your workstreams to version 7.  However, we recognize a significant version 6 user community.  As such, the ImageMagick development team is committed to maintain, but not enhance, version 6 at least until 2028 and possibly beyond.</p>

<p>The ImageMagick development process ensures a stable API and <a href="https://abi-laboratory.pro/tracker/timeline/imagemagick/">ABI</a>. Before each ImageMagick release, we perform a comprehensive security assessment that includes <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer">memory error</a>, <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizer">thread data race</a> detection, and continuous <a href="https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz">fuzzing</a> to detect and prevent security vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Want more performance from ImageMagick?  Try these options:</p>

<ul>
<li>add more memory to your system, see <a href="https://legacy.imagemagick.org/script/architecture.php#cache">the pixel cache</a>;</li>
<li>add more cores to your system, see <a href="https://legacy.imagemagick.org/script/architecture.php#threads">threads of execution support</a>;</li>
<li>reduce lock contention with the <a href="http://goog-perftools.sourceforge.net/doc/tcmalloc.html">tcmalloc</a> memory allocation library;</li>
<li>push large images to a solid-state drive, see <a href="https://legacy.imagemagick.org/script/architecture.php#tera-pixel">large image support</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If these options are prohibitive, you can reduce the quality of the image results.  The default build is Q16.  If you instead use a Q8 build, you use half the memory The trade-off is reduced precision.  For a Q8 build of ImageMagick, use this <code>configure</code> script option: <code>--with-quantum-depth=8</code>.</p>
